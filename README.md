# network-_traffic_classification
A simple network topology was created using VirtualBox as shown in Figure 1. It consisted of 5 Virtual 
Machines: 1 Controller, 1 Layer 2 Switch, and 3 Hosts. The nodes in the network were modeled as VMs 
so that network traffic would experience some delay. Another option was to use Mininet but it wasnâ€™t 
chosen due to the network simulation taking place within a single VM. An overlay network was deployed 
so that the traffic generated by the hosts went through the Switch VM instead of using the VirtualBox 
internal switching mechanism to communicate. The hosts in the network used OVS with 2 interfaces. 
The first interface was internal and the second connected towards the Switch VM OVS using VXLAN 
tunnelling. The Switch OVS had VXLAN interfaces towards the hosts and connected to the Controller VM 
directly (i.e. using underlay IP). The Ryu controller was deployed on the Controller VM.
